# OBS Plugin: Hide Desktop Icons While Streaming

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *to protect your privacy when using Display Capture*

**Supported platform: Windows**

<br>

Just a simple plugin that will automaticall hide icons on your desktop while streaming is active.
It does the same as toggling *Show desktop icons* in the right-click menu on the desktop.

When you start streaming, the desktop icons will hide for the duration of your stream.
When `Stop streaming` is clicked, the icons will show again.

If, for any reason, the desktop icons don't get restored again (due to a bug in this plugin or OBS crashing), you can always manually show the desktop icons by right-clicking on your desktop.

## How it works

Click on `Start Streaming` button in OBS â†’ desktop icons are automatically hidden

Click on `Stop Streaming` button in OBS â†’ desktop icons are automatically shown
